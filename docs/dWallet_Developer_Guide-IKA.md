## **dWallet Developer Guide** 

**Pre-Alpha Disclaimer:** This is a pre-alpha release for development and testing only. Signing uses a single mock signer, not real distributed MPC. All 11 protocol operations are implemented (DKG, Sign, Presign, FutureSign, ReEncryptShare, etc.) across all 4 curves and 7 signature schemes, but without real MPC security guarantees. The dWallet keys, trust model, and signing protocol are not final; do not rely on any key material until mainnet. All interfaces, APIs, and data formats are subject to change without notice. The Solana program and all on-chain data will be wiped periodically and everything will be deleted when we transition to Ika Alpha 1. This software is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind; use is entirely at your own risk and dWallet Labs assumes no liability for any damages arising from its use. 

dWallet enables smart contracts to **control signing keys** on any blockchain. Your program determines what gets signed – the Ika network performs the distributed signing via 2PCMPC. 

## **How It Works** 

1. **Create a dWallet** – the Ika network runs DKG and produces a public key 

2. **Your program controls it** – transfer the dWallet authority to your program’s CPI authority PDA 

3. **Approve messages** – when conditions are met, your program CPI-calls 

   - `approve_message` 

4. **Network signs** – the Ika validator network produces the signature via 2PC-MPC 

5. **Signature stored on-chain** – anyone can read the MessageApproval account to get the signature 

```
// Your program decides when to sign
```

```
fncast_vote(ctx: &DWalletContext, proposal: &Proposal) -> ProgramResult {
if proposal.yes_votes >= proposal.quorum {
```

- `ctx.approve_message(` 

```
            message_approval, dwallet, payer, system_program,
```

- `proposal.message_hash, user_pubkey, signature_scheme, bump, )?;` 

```
    }
Ok(())
}
```

## **Quick Start** 

**Pre-Alpha Disclaimer:** This is a pre-alpha release for development and testing only. Signing uses a single mock signer, not real distributed MPC. All 11 protocol operations are implemented (DKG, Sign, Presign, FutureSign, ReEncryptShare, etc.) across all 4 curves and 7 signature schemes, but without real MPC security guarantees. The dWallet keys, trust model, and signing protocol are not final; do not rely on any key material until mainnet. All interfaces, APIs, and data formats are subject to change without notice. The Solana program and all on-chain data will be wiped periodically and everything will be deleted when we transition to Ika Alpha 1. This software is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind; use is entirely at your own risk and dWallet Labs assumes no liability for any damages arising from its use. 

Build your first dWallet-controlled program in 5 minutes. 

## **1. Create a Solana Program** 

Pick your framework. All four produce interoperable programs: 

**Pinocchio** (maximum CU efficiency, `no_std` ): 

```
[dependencies]
ika-dwallet-pinocchio = { git = "https://github.com/dwallet-labs/ika-pre-alpha"
}
pinocchio = "0.10"
pinocchio-system = "0.5"
```

**Quasar** (zero-copy + declarative validation, `no_std` ): 

```
[dependencies]
ika-dwallet-quasar = { git = "https://github.com/dwallet-labs/ika-pre-alpha" }
quasar-lang = { git = "https://github.com/blueshift-gg/quasar", branch =
"master" }
solana-address = { version = "2.4", features = ["curve25519"] }
```

**Anchor v1** (easiest, declarative): 

```
[dependencies]
ika-dwallet-anchor = { git = "https://github.com/dwallet-labs/ika-pre-alpha" }
anchor-lang = "1"
```

**Native** (standard `solana-program` , no framework): 

5/168 

https://solana-pre-alpha.ika.xyz/print 

dWallet Developer Guide 

30/04/2026, 16:23 

```
[dependencies]
```

```
ika-dwallet-native = { git = "https://github.com/dwallet-labs/ika-pre-alpha" }
solana-program = "2.2"
```

All require: 

```
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "lib"]
```

## **2. Set Up the CPI Context** 

```
#![no_std]
externcrate alloc;
```

```
use pinocchio::{entrypoint, AccountView, Address, ProgramResult};
use ika_dwallet_pinocchio::DWalletContext;
```

```
entrypoint!(process_instruction);
pinocchio::nostd_panic_handler!();
```

```
pubconst ID: Address = Address::new_from_array([5u8; 32]);
```

The `DWalletContext` provides CPI methods for interacting with the dWallet program: 

```
let ctx = DWalletContext {
    dwallet_program,
    cpi_authority,
    caller_program,
    cpi_authority_bump,
};
```

## **3. Approve a Message** 

When your program’s conditions are met, call `approve_message` via CPI: 

```
ctx.approve_message(
    message_approval,   // writable PDA to create
    dwallet,            // the dWallet account
    payer,              // rent payer
    system_program,     // system program
    message_hash,       // 32-byte hash of the message to sign
    user_pubkey,        // 32-byte user public key
    signature_scheme,   // 0=Ed25519, 1=Secp256k1, 2=Secp256r1
    bump,               // MessageApproval PDA bump
)?;
```

https://solana-pre-alpha.ika.xyz/print 

6/168 

dWallet Developer Guide 

30/04/2026, 16:23 

This creates a `MessageApproval` PDA on-chain. The Ika network detects it and produces a signature. 

## **4. Transfer dWallet Authority** 

Before your program can approve messages, the dWallet’s authority must point to your program’s CPI authority PDA: 

```
// Derive the CPI authority PDA
```

```
// Seeds: [b"__ika_cpi_authority"], program_id = YOUR_PROGRAM_ID
let (cpi_authority, _bump) = Address::find_program_address(
```

- `b"__ika_cpi_authority"],` 

- `&your_program_id,` 

```
);
```

```
// Transfer ownership (called by current authority, typically the dWallet
creator)
```

```
ctx.transfer_dwallet(dwallet, cpi_authority.as_array())?;
```

## **5. Read the Signature** 

After the network signs, the `MessageApproval` account contains the signature: 

|**Ofset**|**Field**|**Size**|
|---|---|---|
|139|status|1|
|140|signature_len|2|
|142|signature|up to 128|



Status values: 

- `0` = Pending (awaiting signature) 

- `1` = Signed (signature available) 

## **What Happens Under the Hood** 

1. Your program calls `approve_message` via CPI -> creates a `MessageApproval` PDA (status = Pending) 

2. The Ika network detects the `MessageApproval` account 

3. The NOA (Network Operated Authority) signs the message using 2PC-MPC 

4. The NOA calls `CommitSignature` to write the signature on-chain (status = Signed) 

https://solana-pre-alpha.ika.xyz/print 

7/168 

dWallet Developer Guide 

30/04/2026, 16:23 

5. Anyone can read the signature from the `MessageApproval` account 

In pre-alpha mode, step 3 uses a mock signer. All 11 protocol operations are supported (DKG, Sign, Presign, PresignForDWallet, ImportedKeyVerification, ReEncryptShare, MakeSharePublic, FutureSign, SignWithPartialUserSig, and more) across all 4 curves and 7 signature schemes.

## **Core Concepts** 

**Pre-Alpha Disclaimer:** This is a pre-alpha release for development and testing only. Signing uses a single mock signer, not real distributed MPC. All 11 protocol operations are implemented (DKG, Sign, Presign, FutureSign, ReEncryptShare, etc.) across all 4 curves and 7 signature schemes, but without real MPC security guarantees. The dWallet keys, trust model, and signing protocol are not final; do not rely on any key material until mainnet. All interfaces, APIs, and data formats are subject to change without notice.

This software is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind; use is entirely at your own risk and dWallet Labs assumes no liability for any damages arising from its use. 

## **dWallet** 

A **dWallet** is a distributed signing key controlled by a Solana account. The on-chain `DWallet` account stores the public key, curve type, and authority. The private key never exists in one place – it is split between the user and the Ika validator network via 2PC-MPC (two-party computation with multi-party computation). 

```
DWallet account (on Solana):
  authority(32)        -- who can approve signing
  curve(2)             -- u16 LE: Secp256k1(0), Secp256r1(1), Curve25519(2),
Ristretto(3)
  state(1)             -- DKGInProgress(0), Active(1), Frozen(2)
  public_key_len(1)    -- actual public key length (32 or 33)
  public_key(65)       -- the dWallet's public key (padded to 65 bytes)
  created_epoch(8)     -- epoch when created
  noa_public_key(32)   -- NOA Ed25519 key used during DKG
  is_imported(1)       -- whether the key was imported (vs created via DKG)
  bump(1)              -- PDA bump seed
  _reserved(8)         -- reserved for future use
```

Attestation data (DKG output, proofs, etc.) is stored in separate `DWalletAttestation` PDAs, not inline in the DWallet account. 

A dWallet can sign transactions on **any blockchain** – Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, etc. The curve and signature scheme determine which chains are compatible.

dWallet Developer Guide 

30/04/2026, 16:23 

## **Authority** 

The **authority** of a dWallet controls who can approve messages for signing. It can be: 

- A **user wallet** (direct signer) – the user calls `approve_message` directly 

- A **CPI authority PDA** – a program controls the dWallet and approves messages via CPI 

Transferring authority is done via the `TransferOwnership` instruction. 

## **CPI Authority PDA** 

Every program that wants to control a dWallet derives a **CPI authority PDA** : 

```
Seeds: [b"__ika_cpi_authority"]
Program: YOUR_PROGRAM_ID
```

When a dWallet’s authority is set to your program’s CPI authority PDA, only your program can approve messages for that dWallet. The dWallet program verifies the CPI call chain to ensure the correct program is calling. 

## **Message Approval** 

A **MessageApproval** is a PDA that represents a request to sign a specific message. When your program calls `approve_message` , it creates this PDA: 

```
MessageApproval PDA:
  Seeds: ["dwallet", chunks..., "message_approval", &scheme_u16_le,
&message_digest, [&meta_digest]]
  Program: DWALLET_PROGRAM_ID
```

```
Fields:
```

```
  dwallet(32)                -- the dWallet to sign with
  message_digest(32)         -- keccak256 digest of the message
  message_metadata_digest(32) -- keccak256 digest of metadata (zero if none)
  approver(32)               -- dWallet authority who authorized signing
  user_pubkey(32)            -- user's public key
  signature_scheme(2)        -- DWalletSignatureScheme (u16 LE, values 0-6)
  epoch(8)                   -- epoch when approved
  status(1)                  -- Pending(0) or Signed(1)
  signature_len(2)           -- length of signature bytes
  signature(128)             -- the produced signature (padded)
  bump(1)                    -- PDA bump
  _reserved(8)               -- reserved
```

The Ika network monitors for new `MessageApproval` accounts and produces signatures for those with status = Pending. 

## **NOA (Network Operated Authority)** 

The **NOA** is a special keypair operated by the Ika network. In the pre-alpha, this is a single mock signer. In production, the NOA’s actions are backed by MPC consensus across all validators. 

The NOA: 

- Initializes the dWallet program state (DWalletCoordinator, NetworkEncryptionKey) Commits new dWallets after DKG ( `CommitDWallet` ) 

- Commits signatures after signing ( `CommitSignature` ) 

- Commits attestation PDAs ( `CommitFutureSign` , `CommitEncryptedUserSecretKeyShare` , `CommitPublicUserSecretKeyShare` ) 

- Handles network DKG ( `CommitNetworkDKG` ) and key reconfiguration 

- ( `CommitNetworkKeyReconfiguration` ) 

## **Presign** 

A **presign** is a precomputed partial signature that speeds up the signing process. Presigns are generated in advance and consumed during signing. 

There are two types: 

- **Global presigns** – can be used with any non-imported dWallet (allocated via `Presign` request, uses `signature_algorithm` ) 

- **dWallet-specific presigns** – bound to a specific dWallet by `dwallet_public_key` 

- (allocated via `PresignForDWallet` request, required for imported ECDSA keys) 

Presigns are managed via the gRPC API and returned as 

`Attestation(NetworkSignedAttestation)` containing a 

`VersionedPresignDataAttestation` . 

## **Gas Deposit** 

Programs that use dWallet instructions need a `GasDeposit` PDA. The deposit holds: 

**IKA balance** : For dWallet operation fees (DKG, signing, etc.) 

https://solana-pre-alpha.ika.xyz/print 

11/168 

dWallet Developer Guide 

30/04/2026, 16:23 

**SOL balance** : For NOA write-back transaction costs 

Instructions: `CreateDeposit` (36), `TopUp` (37), `SettleGas` (38), `RequestWithdraw` (44), `Withdraw` (45). 

## **Supported Curves and Signature Schemes** 

|**Curve**|**ID (u16)**|**Description**|**Mock DKG**|
|---|---|---|---|
|Secp256k1|0|Bitcoin, Ethereum|Yes|
|Secp256r1|1|WebAuthn, secure enclaves|Yes|
|Curve25519|2|Solana, Sui, general Ed25519|Yes|
|Ristretto|3|Substrate, Polkadot|Yes|



## **DWalletSignatureScheme (u16)** 

Combined (algorithm, hash) pair used for signing and message approval: 

|**Variant**|**Index**|**Curve**|**Use For**|
|---|---|---|---|
|`EcdsaKeccak256`|0|Secp256k1|Ethereum|
|`EcdsaSha256`|1|Secp256k1 /<br>Secp256r1|Bitcoin (legacy) /<br>WebAuthn|
|`EcdsaDoubleSha256`|2|Secp256k1|Bitcoin BIP143|
|`TaprootSha256`|3|Secp256k1|Bitcoin Taproot<br>(BIP340)|
|`EcdsaBlake2b256`|4|Secp256k1|Zcash|
|`EddsaSha512`|5|Curve25519|Ed25519 (Solana, Sui)|
|`SchnorrkelMerlin`|6|Ristretto|Substrate, Polkadot<br>(sr25519)|



## **DWalletSignatureAlgorithm**

|**Variant**|**Value**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|`ECDSASecp256k1`|0|ECDSA on Secp256k1|
|`ECDSASecp256r1`|1|ECDSA on Secp256r1|
|`Taproot`|2|Schnorr on Secp256k1|

|`Schnorrkel`|4|sr25519 on Ristretto|



## **DKG (Distributed Key Generation)** 

DKG is the process of creating a new dWallet. The user and the Ika network jointly generate a key pair such that: 

- The user holds one share of the private key The network collectively holds the other share Neither party alone can produce a signature 

The on-chain flow: 

1. User submits DKG request via gRPC 

2. Network runs 2PC-MPC DKG protocol 

3. NOA calls `CommitDWallet` to create the on-chain dWallet account and its attestation PDA 

4. The dWallet’s authority is set to the requesting user

## **Tutorial: Voting dWallet** 

**Pre-Alpha Disclaimer:** This is a pre-alpha release for development and testing only. Signing uses a single mock signer, not real distributed MPC. All 11 protocol operations are implemented (DKG, Sign, Presign, FutureSign, ReEncryptShare, etc.) across all 4 curves and 7 signature schemes, but without real MPC security guarantees. The dWallet keys, trust model, and signing protocol are not final; do not rely on any key material until mainnet. All interfaces, APIs, and data formats are subject to change without notice. The Solana program and all on-chain data will be wiped periodically and everything will be deleted when we transition to Ika Alpha 1. This software is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind; use is entirely at your own risk and dWallet Labs assumes no liability for any damages arising from its use. 

This tutorial builds a complete **voting-controlled dWallet** program on Solana. A proposal specifies a message to sign; when enough “yes” votes reach quorum, the program automatically approves the message for signing via CPI. 

## **What You Will Build** 

A Solana program with two instructions: 

|**Instruction**|**Discriminator**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|`create_proposal`|0|Creates a proposal PDA with a target<br>dWallet, message hash, and quorum|
|`cast_vote`|1|Records a vote; when quorum is reached,<br>CPI-calls<br>`approve_message`|



## **How It Works** 

1. A dWallet is created and its authority transferred to the voting program’s CPI authority PDA 

2. The creator submits a proposal referencing the dWallet, message hash, and required quorum 

3. Voters cast yes/no votes – each vote creates a `VoteRecord` PDA (prevents double voting) 

4. When yes votes reach quorum, the program automatically CPI-calls `approve_message` on the dWallet program 

https://solana-pre-alpha.ika.xyz/print 

14/168 

dWallet Developer Guide 

30/04/2026, 16:23 

5. The Ika network detects the `MessageApproval` and produces a signature 

6. The proposal status changes to `Approved` 

## **Key Concepts Covered** 

- **CPI authority pattern** – transferring dWallet control to a program 

- DWalletContext  – the CPI wrapper for calling dWallet instructions 

- approve_message  – creating a MessageApproval PDA to trigger signing 

- **PDA-based vote records** – preventing double voting via account existence **Mollusk tests** – unit testing individual instructions 

- **E2E tests** – full lifecycle against Solana devnet and the pre-alpha gRPC service 

## **Source Code** 

The complete example is at `chains/solana/examples/voting/` . 

## `voting/` 

```

  Cargo.toml
```

## **Prerequisites** 

- Installation complete 

- Familiarity with Core Concepts 

- Basic Solana program development experience

    accounts: &[AccountView],
    data: &[u8],
) -> ProgramResult {
let (discriminator, rest) = data

```

- `0 => create_proposal(program_id, accounts, rest),` 

- `1 => cast_vote(program_id, accounts, rest),` 

```
        _ => Err(ProgramError::InvalidInstructionData),
    }

## **Rent Calculation** 

The dWallet program uses a simple rent formula: 

```
fnminimum_balance(data_len: usize) -> u64 {
    (data_len asu64 + 128) * 6960
}
```

## **Approve Messages** 

**Pre-Alpha Disclaimer:** This is a pre-alpha release for development and testing only. Signing uses a single mock signer, not real distributed MPC. All 11 protocol operations are implemented (DKG, Sign, Presign, FutureSign, ReEncryptShare, etc.) across all 4 curves and 7 signature schemes, but without real MPC security guarantees. The dWallet keys, trust model, and signing protocol are not final; do not rely on any key material until mainnet. All interfaces, APIs, and data formats are subject to change without notice. The Solana program and all on-chain data will be wiped periodically and everything will be deleted when we transition to Ika Alpha 1. This software is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind; use is entirely at your own risk and dWallet Labs assumes no liability for any damages arising from its use. 

## **create_proposal Instruction** 

The `create_proposal` instruction creates a Proposal PDA that references a dWallet and the message to sign.

Ok(())
}
```

The key points: 

- The proposal stores the `message_hash` and `message_approval_bump` so the CPI call can construct the correct MessageApproval PDA later 

- The `user_pubkey` and `signature_scheme` are passed through to `approve_message` when quorum is reached 

- Quorum of zero is rejected 

## **MessageApproval PDA** 

When quorum is reached, the program creates a `MessageApproval` PDA via CPI. This PDA is derived by the **dWallet program** , not the voting program: 

```
Seeds: ["message_approval", dwallet_pubkey, message_hash]
Program: DWALLET_PROGRAM_ID
```

**Important:** The `message_hash` you pass to `approve_message` is the **uniqueness key for the MessageApproval PDA** and must be computed as `keccak256(preimage)` regardless of which destination chain the dWallet will eventually sign for. The dwallet program treats it as opaque 32 bytes; using the same hash function ( `keccak256` , with Solana’s cheap on-chain syscall) for every chain keeps the dwallet program chainagnostic. 

The **digest the dwallet network actually signs** is a separate concern, controlled by the `hash_scheme` field on the gRPC `Sign` request. For Secp256k1 the network applies `hash_scheme(message)` and signs the resulting 32-byte digest via `sign_prehash` , so the produced signature is valid on whichever chain expects that exact hash function ( `Keccak256` for EVM, `DoubleSHA256` for Bitcoin BIP143, etc.). For EVM the on-chain lookup hash and the signing digest happen to coincide; for Bitcoin they differ. The mock supports `hash_scheme` (it used to ignore it and always hash with SHA-256, which produced signatures that wouldn’t verify on real EVM/Bitcoin nodes). 

The dWallet program verifies: 

1. The caller is a valid program (executable account) 

2. The CPI authority PDA matches the dWallet’s current authority 

3. The CPI authority is signed (via `invoke_signed` )

## **Cast Votes** 

**Pre-Alpha Disclaimer:** This is a pre-alpha release for development and testing only. Signing uses a single mock signer, not real distributed MPC. All 11 protocol operations are implemented (DKG, Sign, Presign, FutureSign, ReEncryptShare, etc.) across all 4 curves and 7 signature schemes, but without real MPC security guarantees.

## **Double Vote Prevention** 

The VoteRecord PDA uses seeds `["vote", proposal_id, voter]` . Since `CreateAccount` will fail if the account already exists (non-zero lamports), a voter cannot vote twice on the same proposal. 

## **The CPI Call Chain** 

When quorum triggers `approve_message` , the call chain is: 

## `Voting Program` 

```
  └── invoke_signed (CPI authority PDA signs)
```

```
        └── dWallet Program: approve_message
```

```
              ├── Verifies caller_program is executable
              ├── Verifies cpi_authority = PDA(["__ika_cpi_authority"],
caller_program)
```

```
              ├── Verifies dwallet.authority == cpi_authority
```

```
              └── Creates MessageApproval PDA
```

The `DWalletContext` handles all of this – building the instruction data, assembling accounts, and calling `invoke_signed` with the correct seeds. 

## **Client-Side Account Assembly** 

When constructing the transaction client-side, you need to know whether this vote will trigger quorum. If it will, include the extra 5 accounts: 

```
letmut accounts = vec![
```

```
    AccountMeta::new(proposal_pda, false),
```

```
    AccountMeta::new(vote_record_pda, false),
    AccountMeta::new_readonly(voter.pubkey(), true),
    AccountMeta::new(payer.pubkey(), true),
```

```
    AccountMeta::new_readonly(system_program::id(), false),
];
```

```
// Include CPI accounts if this vote reaches quorum
```

```
if current_yes_votes + 1 >= quorum {
```

```
    accounts.extend_from_slice(&[
```

```
        AccountMeta::new(message_approval_pda, false),
```

```
        AccountMeta::new_readonly(dwallet_pda, false),
        AccountMeta::new_readonly(voting_program_id, false),
        AccountMeta::new_readonly(cpi_authority, false),
        AccountMeta::new_readonly(dwallet_program_id, false),

30/04/2026, 16:23 

## **Verify Signature** 

**Pre-Alpha Disclaimer:** This is a pre-alpha release for development and testing only. Signing uses a single mock signer, not real distributed MPC. All 11 protocol operations are implemented (DKG, Sign, Presign, FutureSign, ReEncryptShare, etc.) across all 4 curves and 7 signature schemes, but without real MPC security guarantees.

This software is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind; use is entirely at your own risk and dWallet Labs assumes no liability for any damages arising from its use. 

## **Reading the Signature** 

After the Ika network signs, the `MessageApproval` account is updated with the signature. You can read it from any client. 

## **MessageApproval Account Layout**

        }
```

```
        std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500));
    }
}
```

## **Signature Verification** 

The signature can be verified against the dWallet’s public key using standard cryptographic libraries. The verification algorithm depends on the signature scheme: 

```
// Ed25519 verification example
use ed25519_dalek::{Signature, VerifyingKey};
```

```
let verifying_key = VerifyingKey::from_bytes(&dwallet_public_key)?;
let signature = Signature::from_bytes(&signature_bytes)?;
verifying_key.verify_strict(&message_hash, &signature)?;
```

For Secp256k1 (Bitcoin/Ethereum): 

```
use secp256k1::{Message, PublicKey, Secp256k1, ecdsa::Signature};
```

```
let secp = Secp256k1::verification_only();
let pubkey = PublicKey::from_slice(&dwallet_public_key)?;
let message = Message::from_digest(message_hash);
let signature = Signature::from_compact(&signature_bytes)?;
secp.verify_ecdsa(&message, &signature, &pubkey)?;

&program_id);
```

```
let ix = build_create_proposal_ix(/* ... */);
let result = mollusk.process_instruction(&ix, &accounts);
```

```
assert!(result.program_result.is_ok());
let prop_data = &result.resulting_accounts[0].1.data;
assert_eq!(prop_data[0], 1); // discriminator
assert_eq!(read_u32(prop_data, 171), 3); // quorum
}
```

## **What to Test with Mollusk** 

|**What to Test with Mollusk**||
|---|---|
|**Test**|**What It Verifes**|
|`test_create_proposal_success`|Proposal PDA created with correct<br>felds|
|`test_create_proposal_already_exists`|Fails when proposal account is non-<br>empty|
|`test_cast_vote_yes_success`|Vote recorded, yes_votes incremented|
|`test_cast_vote_no_success`|No vote recorded, no_votes<br>incremented|
|`test_cast_vote_double_vote_fails`|Second vote by same voter fails|
|`test_cast_vote_closed_proposal_fails`|Voting on approved proposal fails|



Mollusk is fast (no network, no runtime startup) and tests instruction logic in isolation. However, it cannot test the CPI path (quorum triggering `approve_message` ) because it runs a single program.

## **E2E Tests** 

The E2E demo runs the full lifecycle against Solana devnet and the pre-alpha dWallet gRPC service at `pre-alpha-dev-1.ika.ika-network.net:443` : 

```
cargo run -p e2e-voting -- <DWALLET_PROGRAM_ID> <VOTING_PROGRAM_ID>
```

The E2E test performs all 7 steps: 

1. Wait for program state initialization (DWalletCoordinator + NEK) 

2. Create dWallet via gRPC DKG + `CommitDWallet` 

3. Transfer authority to voting program’s CPI PDA 

4. Create a voting proposal (quorum = 3) 

5. Cast 3 YES votes (last triggers `approve_message` CPI) 

6. Verify MessageApproval PDA exists with status = Pending 

7. Presign + Sign via gRPC and verify signature on-chain 

## **Assertions** 

The E2E test verifies: 

- dWallet authority matches CPI PDA after transfer 

- Proposal `yes_votes` = 3 and `status` = Approved after quorum 

- MessageApproval exists with correct `dwallet` and `message_hash` Signature is committed and readable

## **dWallet Accounts** 

**Pre-Alpha Disclaimer:** This is a pre-alpha release for development and testing only. Signing uses a single mock signer, not real distributed MPC. All 11 protocol operations are implemented (DKG, Sign, Presign, FutureSign, ReEncryptShare, etc.) across all 4 curves and 7 signature schemes, but without real MPC security guarantees. The dWallet keys, trust model, and signing protocol are not final; do not rely on any key material until mainnet. All interfaces, APIs, and data formats are subject to change without notice. The Solana program and all on-chain data will be wiped periodically and everything will be deleted when we transition to Ika Alpha 1. This software is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind; use is entirely at your own risk and dWallet Labs assumes no liability for any damages arising from its use. 

## **Overview** 

A dWallet is an on-chain account that represents a distributed signing key. It is created through Distributed Key Generation (DKG) and stored as a PDA owned by the dWallet program. 

## **DWallet Account Layout** 

## `DWallet PDA:` 

```
  Seeds:   ["dwallet", chunks_of(curve_u16_le || public_key)]
  Program: DWALLET_PROGRAM_ID
```

The curve is stored as a `u16` (2 bytes, little-endian) concatenated with the raw public key into a single buffer, which is then split into 32-byte chunks (Solana’s `MAX_SEED_LEN` ) and each chunk is passed as its own PDA seed. This is lossless and curve-agnostic – 

`find_program_address` accepts up to `MAX_SEEDS = 16` total seeds, so different pubkey lengths simply produce different chunk counts: 

| pubkey | payload ( `curve_u16_le || pk` ) | chunks | |—|—|—| | 32 bytes (Ed25519 / Curve25519 / Ristretto) | 34 bytes | `[32, 2]` | | 33 bytes (compressed Secp256k1 / Secp256r1) | 35 bytes | `[32, 3]` | | 65 bytes (uncompressed SEC1) | 67 bytes | `[32, 32, 3]` |

## **Total: 153 bytes (2 header + 151 data)** 

Attestation data (DKG output, proofs, etc.) is stored in separate variable-size `DWalletAttestation` PDAs rooted from this dWallet’s seed hierarchy, not inline in the DWallet account. 

The `authority` field determines who can call `approve_message` for this dWallet: 

- A **user pubkey** – the user signs the `approve_message` instruction directly A **CPI authority PDA** – a program controls the dWallet via CPI 

## **DWalletAttestation Account** 

Variable-size PDA storing BCS-serialized versioned attestation data + NOA Ed25519 signature. One attestation PDA per type per dWallet. 

```
Account layout: [discriminator(1), version(1), noa_signature(64), bump(1),
attestation_data...]
```

**Discriminator:** `15` **Header:** 67 bytes (1 + 1 + 64 + 1), followed by variable-length attestation data. 

Multiple PDA seed patterns depending on the type:

## **Creating a dWallet** 

dWallets are created through the gRPC API, not directly on-chain. The flow: 

1. User sends a `DKG` request via gRPC with their key share 

2. The Ika network runs the 2PC-MPC DKG protocol 

3. The NOA calls `CommitDWallet` on-chain to create the dWallet account and its DKG attestation PDA 

4. The dWallet’s authority is set to the user 

```
// Client-side: request DKG via gRPC
let request = DWalletRequest::DKG {
    dwallet_network_encryption_public_key: nek_bytes,
    curve: DWalletCurve::Secp256k1,
```

```
    centralized_public_key_share_and_proof: user_share,
```

```
// Zero-trust mode. Use UserSecretKeyShare::Public { .. } for trust-
minimized.
```

```
    user_secret_key_share: UserSecretKeyShare::Encrypted {
        encrypted_centralized_secret_share_and_proof: encrypted_share,
        encryption_key: enc_key,
        signer_public_key: signer_pk,
    },
    user_public_output: user_output,
// Set to Some(SignDuringDKGRequest { .. }) to atomically sign a
// message during DKG. `None` for plain DKG.
    sign_during_dkg_request: None,
};
```

## **Transferring Authority** 

To give a program control over a dWallet, transfer its authority to the program’s CPI authority PDA: 

https://solana-pre-alpha.ika.xyz/print 

38/168 

30/04/2026, 16:23 dWallet Developer Guide 

```
// Derive the CPI authority PDA for your program
let (cpi_authority, _) = Pubkey::find_program_address(
    &[b"__ika_cpi_authority"],
    &your_program_id,
);
```

```
// TransferOwnership instruction (called by current authority)
let ix = Instruction::new_with_bytes(
    dwallet_program_id,
    &transfer_data, // [IX_TRANSFER_OWNERSHIP, new_authority(32)]
vec![
        AccountMeta::new_readonly(current_authority, true), // signer
        AccountMeta::new(dwallet_pda, false),               // writable
    ],
);
```

After transfer, the dWallet’s `authority` field equals the CPI authority PDA, and only the owning program can approve messages. 

## **Via CPI (Program-to-Program Transfer)** 

If a program already controls a dWallet, it can transfer authority to another program’s CPI PDA: 

```
let ctx = DWalletContext {
    dwallet_program,
    cpi_authority,
    caller_program,
    cpi_authority_bump,
};
```

```
ctx.transfer_dwallet(dwallet, new_authority)?;
```

## **Message Approval** 

**Pre-Alpha Disclaimer:** This is a pre-alpha release for development and testing only. Signing uses a single mock signer, not real distributed MPC. All 11 protocol operations are implemented (DKG, Sign, Presign, FutureSign, ReEncryptShare, etc.) across all 4 curves and 7 signature schemes, but without real MPC security guarantees. The dWallet keys, trust model, and signing protocol are not final; do not rely on any key material until mainnet. All interfaces, APIs, and data formats are subject to change without notice. The Solana program and all on-chain data will be wiped periodically and everything will be deleted when we transition to Ika Alpha 1. This software is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind; use is entirely at your own risk and dWallet Labs assumes no liability for any damages arising from its use. 

## **Overview** 

Message approval is the core mechanism for requesting signatures from the Ika network. When you call `approve_message` , it creates a `MessageApproval` PDA on-chain. The network detects this account and produces a signature. 

## **MessageApproval Account** 

```
MessageApproval PDA:
```

```
  Seeds: ["dwallet", chunks..., "message_approval", &scheme_u16_le,
&message_digest, [&message_metadata_digest]]
  Program: DWALLET_PROGRAM_ID
  Total: 312 bytes (2 header + 310 data)
```

The PDA is rooted from the parent dWallet’s `curve_u16_le || public_key` chunks (same hierarchy as all dWallet-derived PDAs). The `message_metadata_digest` seed is only included when non-zero. 

The `message_digest` must be the **keccak256** hash of the message you want signed: 

```
let message_digest = solana_sdk::keccak::hash(message).to_bytes();
```

```
import { keccak_256 } from"@noble/hashes/sha3.js";
const messageDigest = keccak_256(message);
```

dWallet Developer Guide

This is consistent across all examples, the mock, and the gRPC service. Using any other hash function will result in a PDA mismatch when the network tries to commit the signature onchain.

**Note:** `signature_scheme` is now `[u8; 2]` (u16 LE) encoding a `DWalletSignatureScheme` value (0-6), not a single-byte `SignatureScheme` . The field `message_hash` has been renamed to `message_digest` , and `message_metadata_digest` is new. 

## **Approval Flow** 

## **Direct Approval (User Signer)** 

When the dWallet’s authority is a user wallet: 

```
User signs approve_message instruction
```

- `-> dWallet program verifies user == dwallet.authority` 

- `-> Creates MessageApproval PDA (status = Pending)`

30/04/2026, 16:23 

## **CPI Approval (Program Signer)** 

When the dWallet’s authority is a CPI authority PDA: 

```
Your program calls DWalletContext::approve_message
```

- `-> invoke_signed with CPI authority seeds` 

- `-> dWallet program verifies:` 

   - `caller_program is executable` 

   - `cpi_authority == PDA(["__ika_cpi_authority"], caller_program)` 

   - `dwallet.authority == cpi_authority` 

- `-> Creates MessageApproval PDA (status = Pending)` 

## **approve_message Instruction** 

## **Discriminator:** `8` 

The first account is the `DWalletCoordinator` PDA (used to read the current epoch).

## **Signature Lifecycle** 

1. **Pending** : Your program calls `approve_message` -> MessageApproval created, `status = 0` , `signature_len = 0` 

2. **gRPC Sign** : You send a `Sign` request via gRPC with `ApprovalProof` referencing the onchain approval. The network returns the 64-byte signature directly and commits it onchain via `CommitSignature` . 

3. **Signed** : `status = 1` , signature bytes written, readable by anyone. 

```
Your program calls approve_message (CPI)
```

- `-> MessageApproval PDA created (status = Pending)` 

- `-> You send gRPC Sign request with ApprovalProof` 

- `-> Network signs and returns signature via gRPC` 

- `-> Network calls CommitSignature on-chain` 

- `-> status = Signed, signature available` 

The signature is available both from the gRPC response and on-chain in the MessageApproval account. 

## **CommitSignature Instruction** 

Called by the NOA to write the signature into the MessageApproval account (or a PartialUserSignature account – dispatches by the target account’s discriminator). 

## **Discriminator:** `43` 

## **Instruction Data:** 

|**Ofset**|**Field**|**Size**|
|---|---|---|
|0|discriminator|1|
|1|signature_len|2|
|3|signature|128|



## **Accounts:**

|---|---|---|---|---|
|0|target_account|yes|no|MessageApproval or PartialUserSignature<br>PDA|
|1|nek|no|no|NetworkEncryptionKey PDA|
|2|noa|no|yes|NOA signer|

dWallet Developer Guide 

30/04/2026, 16:23 

## **Reading the Signature** 

```
let data = client.get_account(&message_approval_pda)?.data;
```

```
let status = data[172];
if status == 1 {
let sig_len = u16::from_le_bytes(data[173..175].try_into().unwrap()) as
usize;
let signature = &data[175..175 + sig_len];
// Use the signature
}
```

## **Idempotency** 

The same `(dwallet_root, scheme, message_digest, message_metadata_digest)` tuple always derives the same MessageApproval PDA. Attempting to create a MessageApproval that already exists will fail (the account is non-empty). This prevents duplicate signing requests.

## **CPI Framework** 

**Pre-Alpha Disclaimer:** This is a pre-alpha release for development and testing only. Signing uses a single mock signer, not real distributed MPC. All 11 protocol operations are implemented (DKG, Sign, Presign, FutureSign, ReEncryptShare, etc.) across all 4 curves and 7 signature schemes, but without real MPC security guarantees. The dWallet keys, trust model, and signing protocol are not final; do not rely on any key material until mainnet. All interfaces, APIs, and data formats are subject to change without notice.

This software is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind; use is entirely at your own risk and dWallet Labs assumes no liability for any damages arising from its use. 

## **DWalletContext** 

The CPI SDK is available for four Solana frameworks: 

|**Crate**|**Framework**|**Account type**|
|---|---|---|
|`ika-dwallet-`<br>`pinocchio`|Pinocchio|`&AccountView`|
|`ika-dwallet-native`|solana-<br>program|`&AccountInfo<'info>`|
|`ika-dwallet-anchor`|Anchor v1|`AccountInfo<'info>`|
|`ika-dwallet-quasar`|Quasar|`&AccountView`(via<br>`.to_account_view()`)|



All four provide an identical `DWalletContext` with the same methods and wire format. 

```
use ika_dwallet_pinocchio::DWalletContext; // or _anchor, _native, _quasar
```

```
let ctx = DWalletContext {
    dwallet_program: &dwallet_program_account,
    cpi_authority: &cpi_authority_account,
    caller_program: &my_program_account,
    cpi_authority_bump: bump,
};
```

|**Field**|**Type**|**Description**|

## **CPI Authority PDA** 

Every program derives its CPI authority from a single seed: 

```
pubconst CPI_AUTHORITY_SEED: &[u8] = b"__ika_cpi_authority";
```

```
// Derivation:
let (cpi_authority, bump) = Address::find_program_address(
    &[CPI_AUTHORITY_SEED],
    &your_program_id,
);
```

The dWallet program verifies this derivation during CPI calls. 

## **Available Methods** 

## **approve_message** 

Creates a `MessageApproval` PDA requesting a signature. The first account is the `DWalletCoordinator` PDA (used to read the current epoch). 

```
ctx.approve_message(
    coordinator,        // readonly -- DWalletCoordinator PDA (for epoch)
    message_approval,   // writable, empty -- PDA to create
    dwallet,            // readonly -- the dWallet account
    payer,              // writable, signer -- rent payer
    system_program,     // readonly -- system program
    message_digest,     // [u8; 32] -- keccak256 hash of message
    message_metadata_digest, // [u8; 32] -- keccak256 hash of metadata (zero if
none)
    user_pubkey,        // [u8; 32] -- user public key
    signature_scheme,   // u16 -- DWalletSignatureScheme value (0-6)
    bump,               // u8 -- MessageApproval PDA bump
)?;
```

**CPI instruction data:** `[8, bump, message_digest(32), message_metadata_digest(32), user_pubkey(32), signature_scheme(2)]` = 100 bytes.

## **transfer_dwallet** 

Transfers dWallet authority to a new pubkey. 

```
ctx.transfer_dwallet(
    dwallet,         // writable -- the dWallet account
    new_authority,   // [u8; 32] -- new authority pubkey
)?;
```

|**#**|**Account**|**W**|**S**|
|---|---|---|---|
|0|caller_program|no|no|

```
ctx.transfer_future_sign(
    partial_user_sig,          // writable -- partial signature account
    new_completion_authority,  // [u8; 32] -- new authority pubkey
)?;
```

**CPI instruction data:** `[42, new_completion_authority(32)]` = 33 bytes.

|0|partial_user_sig|yes|no|
|1|caller_program|no|no|
|2|cpi_authority|no|yes|



## **Signing Mechanism** 

All CPI methods use `invoke_signed` with the CPI authority seeds: 

```
let bump_byte = [self.cpi_authority_bump];
let signer_seeds: [Seed; 2] = [
    Seed::from(CPI_AUTHORITY_SEED),
    Seed::from(&bump_byte),
```

```
];
```

```
let signer = Signer::from(&signer_seeds);
```

```
invoke_signed(&instruction, &accounts, &[signer])
```

## The dWallet program verifies: 

1. `caller_program` is executable 

2. `cpi_authority` matches `PDA(["__ika_cpi_authority"], caller_program)` 

3. `dwallet.authority == cpi_authority` (for `approve_message` and `transfer_dwallet` ) 

## **Instruction Discriminators**

## **Gas Deposits** 

**Pre-Alpha Disclaimer:** This is a pre-alpha release for development and testing only. Signing uses a single mock signer, not real distributed MPC. All 11 protocol operations are implemented (DKG, Sign, Presign, FutureSign, ReEncryptShare, etc.) across all 4 curves and 7 signature schemes, but without real MPC security guarantees. The dWallet keys, trust model, and signing protocol are not final; do not rely on any key material until mainnet. All interfaces, APIs, and data formats are subject to change without notice. The Solana program and all on-chain data will be wiped periodically and everything will be deleted when we transition to Ika Alpha 1. This software is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind; use is entirely at your own risk and dWallet Labs assumes no liability for any damages arising from its use.

## **Rent Costs by Account Type** 

The dWallet program uses a simplified rent formula: 

```
fnminimum_balance(data_len: usize) -> u64 {
    (data_len asu64 + 128) * 6960
}
```

This approximation of the Solana rent-exempt minimum is used for all PDA creation. 

|**Account**|**Size (bytes)**|**Approximate Rent (lamports)**|
|---|---|---|
|DWallet|153|~1,955,280|
|DWalletAttestation|67 + data|varies|
|MessageApproval|312|~3,062,400|
|PartialUserSignature|570|~4,858,080|

|Proposal (voting example)|195|~2,248,080|
|VoteRecord (voting example)|69|~1,371,480|



## **Payer Account** 

Every instruction that creates a PDA requires a `payer` account: 

- Must be writable and signer 

- Must have sufficient lamports to cover rent 

- Is debited via `CreateAccount` system instruction 

## **Future: Production Gas Model** 

In production, the Ika network will have a gas model for signing operations. This may include: 

- Presign allocation fees 

- Signing operation fees 

- Staking requirements for validators 

The exact model is not finalized.

## **SubmitTransaction** 

**Pre-Alpha Disclaimer:** This is a pre-alpha release for development and testing only. Signing uses a single mock signer, not real distributed MPC. All 11 protocol operations are implemented (DKG, Sign, Presign, FutureSign, ReEncryptShare, etc.) across all 4 curves and 7 signature schemes, but without real MPC security guarantees. The dWallet keys, trust model, and signing protocol are not final; do not rely on any key material until mainnet. All interfaces, APIs, and data formats are subject to change without notice. The Solana program and all on-chain data will be wiped periodically and everything will be deleted when we transition to Ika Alpha 1. This software is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind; use is entirely at your own risk and dWallet Labs assumes no liability for any damages arising from its use. 

## **Overview** 

`SubmitTransaction` is the primary gRPC RPC for all dWallet operations. It accepts a `UserSignedRequest` and returns a `TransactionResponse` . 

The request type is determined by the `DWalletRequest` enum variant inside the BCSserialized payload. This means a single RPC endpoint handles DKG, signing, presigning, and other operations. 

## **Service Definition** 

```
service DWalletService {
```

```
  rpc SubmitTransaction(UserSignedRequest) returns (TransactionResponse);
  rpc GetPresigns(GetPresignsRequest) returns (GetPresignsResponse);
  rpc GetPresignsForDWallet(GetPresignsForDWalletRequest) returns
(GetPresignsResponse);
}
```

## **UserSignedRequest** 

All mutation requests are wrapped in `UserSignedRequest` : 

53/168 

https://solana-pre-alpha.ika.xyz/print 

dWallet Developer Guide 

30/04/2026, 16:23 

```
message UserSignedRequest {
  bytes user_signature = 1;      // BCS-serialized UserSignature enum
  bytes signed_request_data = 2; // BCS-serialized SignedRequestData
}
```

|**Field**|**Type**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|`user_signature`|bytes|BCS-serialized<br>`UserSignature`enum (signature<br>+ public key + scheme)|
|`signed_request_data`|bytes|BCS-serialized<br>`SignedRequestData`(the signed<br>payload)|



The `user_signature` covers the `signed_request_data` bytes – validators independently verify the signature. 

## **Authentication** 

The `UserSignature` enum is self-contained: it carries both the signature bytes and the public key bytes, with the variant determining the scheme: 

```
pubenumUserSignature {
    Ed25519 {
        signature: Vec<u8>,   // 64 bytes
        public_key: Vec<u8>,  // 32 bytes
    },
    Secp256k1 {
        signature: Vec<u8>,   // 64 bytes
        public_key: Vec<u8>,  // 33 bytes (compressed)
    },
    Secp256r1 {
        signature: Vec<u8>,   // 64 bytes
        public_key: Vec<u8>,  // 33 bytes (compressed)
    },
}
```

## **Signed Payload** 

The `SignedRequestData` struct contains the operation to perform:

dWallet Developer Guide 

30/04/2026, 16:23 

```
pubstructSignedRequestData {
pub session_identifier_preimage: [u8; 32],
pub epoch: u64,
pub chain_id: ChainId,
pub intended_chain_sender: Vec<u8>,
pub request: DWalletRequest,
}
```

|**Field**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`session_identifier_preimage`|Random 32 bytes (uniqueness nonce)|
|`epoch`|Current Ika epoch (prevents cross-epoch replay)|
|`chain_id`|`Solana`or<br>`Sui`|
|`intended_chain_sender`|User’s address on the target chain|
|`request`|The<br>`DWalletRequest`enum variant|



## **TransactionResponse** 

```
message TransactionResponse {
  bytes response_data = 1; // BCS-serialized TransactionResponseData
}
```

Deserialize `response_data` into `TransactionResponseData` to get the result: 

```
pubenumTransactionResponseData {
    Signature { signature: Vec<u8> },
    Attestation(NetworkSignedAttestation),
    Error { message: String },
}
```

Three variants only – presigns now flow through `Attestation(NetworkSignedAttestation)` .

## **Request Types** 

**Pre-Alpha Disclaimer:** This is a pre-alpha release for development and testing only. Signing uses a single mock signer, not real distributed MPC. All 11 protocol operations are implemented (DKG, Sign, Presign, FutureSign, ReEncryptShare, etc.) across all 4 curves and 7 signature schemes, but without real MPC security guarantees. The dWallet keys, trust model, and signing protocol are not final; do not rely on any key material until mainnet. All interfaces, APIs, and data formats are subject to change without notice. The Solana program and all on-chain data will be wiped periodically and everything will be deleted when we transition to Ika Alpha 1. This software is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind; use is entirely at your own risk and dWallet Labs assumes no liability for any damages arising from its use. 

## **DWalletRequest Enum** 

All operations are encoded as variants of the `DWalletRequest` enum, BCS-serialized inside `SignedRequestData.request` . 

```
pubenumDWalletRequest {
    DKG { ... },
    Sign { ... },
    ImportedKeySign { ... },
    Presign { ... },
    PresignForDWallet { ... },

    MakeSharePublic { ... },
    FutureSign { ... },
    SignWithPartialUserSig { ... },
    ImportedKeySignWithPartialUserSig { ... },
}
```

## **Mock Support** 

All request types are implemented and tested end-to-end (see `protocols-e2e` example).

## **DKG** 

Create a new dWallet via Distributed Key Generation. The `user_secret_key_share` field selects between **zero-trust** mode (encrypted user share) and **trust-minimized** mode (public user share) – mirrors Sui move `UserSecretKeyShareEventType` . 

```
DWalletRequest::DKG {
    dwallet_network_encryption_public_key: Vec<u8>,
    curve: DWalletCurve,
    centralized_public_key_share_and_proof: Vec<u8>,
    user_secret_key_share: UserSecretKeyShare,
    user_public_output: Vec<u8>,
    sign_during_dkg_request: Option<SignDuringDKGRequest>,
}
pubenumUserSecretKeyShare {
/// Zero-trust mode.

        signer_public_key: Vec<u8>,  // Ed25519, signs the public output to
prove ownership
    },
/// Trust-minimized mode -- secret share revealed.
    Public {
        public_user_secret_key_share: Vec<u8>,
    },
}
```

|**Field**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`dwallet_network_encryption_public_key`|Network encryption key (from on-<br>chain NEK account)|
|`curve`|Target curve (Secp256k1, Secp256r1,<br>Curve25519, Ristretto)|
|`centralized_public_key_share_and_proof`|User’s public key share + ZK proof|
|`user_secret_key_share`|`Encrypted { ... }`for zero-trust,<br>`Public { ... }`for trust-minimized|
|`user_public_output`|User’s DKG public output|
|`sign_during_dkg_request`|Optional – atomically sign a message<br>during DKG (<br>`None`for plain DKG)|



**Note:** `signer_public_key` lives inside the `Encrypted` variant only. Trust-minimized mode has no secret to prove possession of. 

**Response:** `TransactionResponseData::Attestation(NetworkSignedAttestation)` with the DKG output and NOA attestation. The `attestation_data` decodes to 

`VersionedDWalletDataAttestation` .

## **SignDuringDKGRequest** 

Optional payload attached to `DKG` to atomically sign a message during DKG. 

```
pubstructSignDuringDKGRequest {
pub presign_session_identifier: Vec<u8>,
pub presign: Vec<u8>,
pub signature_scheme: DWalletSignatureScheme,
pub message: Vec<u8>,
pub message_metadata: Vec<u8>,
pub message_centralized_signature: Vec<u8>,
}
```

|**Field**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`presign_session_identifier`|Presign session identifer (from a prior<br>`Presign`response)|
|`presign`|Presign material|
|`signature_scheme`|`DWalletSignatureScheme`enum|
|`message`|Raw message bytes to sign|
|`message_metadata`|BCS-serialized per-scheme metadata (empty<br>for most schemes)|
|`message_centralized_signature`|User’s centralized-party partial signature|



The curve is inherited from the parent DKG request. 

## **Sign** 

Sign a message using an existing dWallet. 

```
DWalletRequest::Sign {
    message: Vec<u8>,
    message_metadata: Vec<u8>,
    presign_session_identifier: Vec<u8>,
    message_centralized_signature: Vec<u8>,
    dwallet_attestation: NetworkSignedAttestation,
    approval_proof: ApprovalProof,
}
```

**Field Description** `message` Raw message bytes to sign BCS-serialized per-scheme metadata (see `Blake2bMessageMetadata` , `message_metadata SchnorrkelMessageMetadata` ). Empty for most schemes.

|---|---|
|**Field**|**Description**|
|`presign_session_identifier`|Session identifer of a previously allocated<br>presign|
|`message_centralized_signature`|User’s partial signature|
|`dwallet_attestation`|`NetworkSignedAttestation`from the DKG<br>response (proves the dWallet exists)|
|`approval_proof`|On-chain proof of message approval|



Note: `curve` and `signature_scheme` are no longer fields on `Sign` – validators derive the signature scheme from the on-chain `MessageApproval` and the curve from the `dwallet_attestation` . 

**Response:** `TransactionResponseData::Signature` with the completed signature. 

## **ImportedKeySign** 

Same as `Sign` but for imported-key dWallets. Validators additionally verify `is_imported_key == true` on the referenced dWallet. 

```
DWalletRequest::ImportedKeySign {
    message: Vec<u8>,
    message_metadata: Vec<u8>,
    presign_session_identifier: Vec<u8>,
    message_centralized_signature: Vec<u8>,
    dwallet_attestation: NetworkSignedAttestation,
    approval_proof: ApprovalProof,
}
```

## **ApprovalProof** 

The approval proof ties the gRPC signing request to an on-chain `MessageApproval` : 

```
pubenumApprovalProof {
    Solana {
        transaction_signature: Vec<u8>, // Solana tx signature
        slot: u64,                       // Slot of the transaction
    },
    Sui {
        effects_certificate: Vec<u8>,    // Sui effects certificate
    },
}
```

## **Presign** 

Allocate a global presign (usable with any non-imported dWallet for the same `signature_algorithm` ). 

```
DWalletRequest::Presign {
```

```
    dwallet_network_encryption_public_key: Vec<u8>,
    curve: DWalletCurve,
    signature_algorithm: DWalletSignatureAlgorithm,
}
```

|**Field**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`dwallet_network_encryption_public_key`|Network encryption key|
|`curve`|Target curve|
|`signature_algorithm`|`DWalletSignatureAlgorithm`<br>(ECDSASecp256k1, ECDSASecp256r1,<br>Taproot, EdDSA, Schnorrkel)|



Note: uses `signature_algorithm` (not `signature_scheme` ). Presigns are per-algorithm, not per-scheme, because the hash function is applied at signing time. 

**Response:** `TransactionResponseData::Attestation(NetworkSignedAttestation)` . The `attestation_data` decodes to `VersionedPresignDataAttestation` . 

## **PresignForDWallet** 

Allocate a presign bound to a specific dWallet (required for imported ECDSA dWallets). Runs a full 2-round MPC presign protocol – significantly slower than global presigns. 

```
DWalletRequest::PresignForDWallet {
    dwallet_network_encryption_public_key: Vec<u8>,
    dwallet_public_key: Vec<u8>,
    curve: DWalletCurve,
    signature_algorithm: DWalletSignatureAlgorithm,
}
```

|**Field**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`dwallet_network_encryption_public_key`|Network encryption key|
|`dwallet_public_key`|Public key of the target dWallet (not a<br>dWallet ID)|
|`curve`|Target curve|
|`signature_algorithm`|`DWalletSignatureAlgorithm`|

## **NetworkSignedAttestation** 

Common response / request payload for state-creating operations – carries a networksigned blob the user can either (a) submit on-chain to claim the result or (b) feed back to the network in a follow-up request (e.g. `SignWithPartialUserSig` ). 

```
pubstructNetworkSignedAttestation {
pub attestation_data: Vec<u8>,      // BCS-serialized per-type versioned
attestation struct
pub network_signature: Vec<u8>,     // Ed25519 signature from the NOA
pub network_pubkey: Vec<u8>,        // NOA public key (matches active
NetworkEncryptionKey)
pub epoch: u64,                     // Epoch this attestation was produced
in
}
```

The `attestation_data` contains BCS-serialized bytes of a per-type versioned struct. The caller knows which type based on the originating request: 

**Request Attestation Type** `VersionedDWalletDataAttestation` DKG / ImportedKeyVerification Presign / PresignForDWallet `VersionedPresignDataAttestation` FutureSign `VersionedPartialUserSignatureAttestation` ReEncryptShare `VersionedEncryptedUserKeyShareAttestation` MakeSharePublic `VersionedPublicUserKeyShareAttestation` 

## **ImportedKeyVerification** 

Verify an externally-generated key as a new dWallet (no DKG). Uses `UserSecretKeyShare` to select zero-trust or trust-minimized mode, same as DKG. 

```
DWalletRequest::ImportedKeyVerification {
    dwallet_network_encryption_public_key: Vec<u8>,
    curve: DWalletCurve,
    centralized_party_message: Vec<u8>,
    user_secret_key_share: UserSecretKeyShare,
    user_public_output: Vec<u8>,
}
```

## **Field Description** 

`dwallet_network_encryption_public_key` Network encryption key `curve` Target curve `centralized_party_message` Centralized party verification message

**Response:** `TransactionResponseData::Attestation(NetworkSignedAttestation)` . User submits the attestation on-chain to create the imported-key dWallet. 

## **ReEncryptShare** 

Re-encrypt a dWallet’s user secret share under a new encryption key (to transfer / grant access). Wire format defined; not yet implemented in mock. 

```
DWalletRequest::ReEncryptShare {

|`dwallet_attestation`|The dWallet’s DKG attestation|
|`encrypted_centralized_secret_share_and_proof`|The re-encrypted share +<br>proof|
|`encryption_key`|New encryption key|



The previous share (the source) and the dWallet’s `public_output` are looked up by validators from local state using `dwallet_public_key` . 

**Response:** `TransactionResponseData::Attestation(NetworkSignedAttestation)` . The `attestation_data` decodes to `VersionedEncryptedUserKeyShareAttestation` . 

## **MakeSharePublic** 

Transition a zero-trust dWallet to trust-minimized by revealing the user’s secret key share. One-way. Wire format defined; not yet implemented in mock.

**Response:** `TransactionResponseData::Attestation(NetworkSignedAttestation)` . The `attestation_data` decodes to `VersionedPublicUserKeyShareAttestation` . 

## **FutureSign** 

Step 1 of two-step conditional signing – produce a verified partial user signature without an approval proof. Consumes a presign. Wire format defined; not yet implemented in mock. 

```
DWalletRequest::FutureSign {

## **SignWithPartialUserSig** 

Step 2 of two-step conditional signing – complete the signature using the attestation returned by `FutureSign` . Requires an on-chain approval proof, just like `Sign` . Wire format defined; not yet implemented in mock. 

## `DWalletRequest::SignWithPartialUserSig {` 

```
    partial_user_signature_attestation: NetworkSignedAttestation,
    dwallet_attestation: NetworkSignedAttestation,
    approval_proof: ApprovalProof,
```

```
}
```

|**Field**|**Description**|

|`partial_user_signature_attestation`|Attestation from<br>`FutureSign`|
|`dwallet_attestation`|The dWallet’s DKG attestation|
|`approval_proof`|On-chain proof of message approval|



**Response:** `TransactionResponseData::Signature` . 

## **ImportedKeySignWithPartialUserSig** 

Imported-key variant of `SignWithPartialUserSig` . Validators additionally verify the referenced dWallet was created from an imported key. Wire format defined; not yet implemented in mock. 

## `DWalletRequest::ImportedKeySignWithPartialUserSig {` 

```
    partial_user_signature_attestation: NetworkSignedAttestation,

**Variant Value Description** `Ristretto` 3 Substrate, Polkadot 

On-wire encoding: `u16` (LE in on-chain accounts, BCS-serialized for gRPC). 

## **DWalletSignatureScheme** 

Combined (algorithm, hash) pair. Eliminates impossible combinations like `ECDSA + Merlin` at the type level. The on-wire encoding is `u16` ( `#[repr(u16)]` ).

Not every (curve, scheme) combination is valid. Validators reject invalid pairs (e.g. `Curve25519 + EcdsaKeccak256` , `Secp256r1 + Taproot` ). Ordering: variants 0-4 are Secp256k1 (with 1 also usable on Secp256r1), variant 5 is Curve25519, variant 6 is Ristretto. 

## **DWalletSignatureAlgorithm** 

Used by `Presign` and `PresignForDWallet` requests (presigns are per-algorithm, not perscheme): 

|**Variant**|**Value**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|`ECDSASecp256k1`|0|ECDSA on Secp256k1|

## **Message Metadata** 

Some signature schemes require additional metadata, BCS-serialized and passed in the `message_metadata` field: 

Blake2bMessageMetadata  (for `EcdsaBlake2b256` ): 

```
pubstructBlake2bMessageMetadata {
pub personal: Vec<u8>,  // BLAKE2b personalization (up to 16 bytes)
pub salt: Vec<u8>,      // BLAKE2b salt (up to 16 bytes, empty for most
uses)
}
```

Example (Zcash): `personal: b"ZcashSigHash\x00\x00\x00\x00"` , `salt: vec![]` . 

SchnorrkelMessageMetadata  (for `SchnorrkelMerlin` ): 

```
pubstructSchnorrkelMessageMetadata {
pub context: Vec<u8>,  // Signing context (domain separator for Merlin
transcript)
}
```

Example (Substrate): `context: b"substrate"` . If empty, validators default to `b"substrate"` . 

## **DWalletSignatureAlgorithm / DWalletHashScheme (internal)** 

The internal MPC stack still uses these granular enums. They are not on the wire – the gRPC adapter converts `DWalletSignatureScheme` to/from these at the validator boundary via `to_internal()` / `from_internal()` . 

## **ChainId** 

|**Variant**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Solana`|Solana blockchain|
|`Sui`|Sui blockchain|



## **SignatureScheme (User Authentication)** 

Used in `UserSignature` for gRPC request authentication (not for dWallet signing): 

|**Variant**|**Value**|**Key Size**|
|---|---|---|
|`Ed25519`|0|32 bytes|
|`Secp256k1`|1|33 bytes|

## **Response Types** 

**Pre-Alpha Disclaimer:** This is a pre-alpha release for development and testing only. Signing uses a single mock signer, not real distributed MPC. All 11 protocol operations are implemented (DKG, Sign, Presign, FutureSign, ReEncryptShare, etc.) across all 4 curves and 7 signature schemes, but without real MPC security guarantees. The dWallet keys, trust model, and signing protocol are not final; do not rely on any key material until mainnet. All interfaces, APIs, and data formats are subject to change without notice. The Solana program and all on-chain data will be wiped periodically and everything will be deleted when we transition to Ika Alpha 1. This software is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind; use is entirely at your own risk and dWallet Labs assumes no liability for any damages arising from its use. 

## **TransactionResponseData** 

The `SubmitTransaction` RPC returns a `TransactionResponse` containing BCS-serialized `TransactionResponseData` : 

```
pubenumTransactionResponseData {
    Signature { signature: Vec<u8> },
    Attestation(NetworkSignedAttestation),
    Error { message: String },
}
```

`Attestation` – there is Three variants only. Presigns are now NOA-signed and flow through no separate `Presign` variant. 

## **Response Variants** 

## **Signature** 

Returned for `Sign` , `ImportedKeySign` , `SignWithPartialUserSig` , and `ImportedKeySignWithPartialUserSig` requests. 

```
TransactionResponseData::Signature {
    signature: Vec<u8>,  // The completed signature bytes
}

## **Mollusk Tests** 

**Pre-Alpha Disclaimer:** This is a pre-alpha release for development and testing only. Signing uses a single mock signer, not real distributed MPC. All 11 protocol operations are implemented (DKG, Sign, Presign, FutureSign, ReEncryptShare, etc.) across all 4 curves and 7 signature schemes, but without real MPC security guarantees. The dWallet keys, trust model, and signing protocol are not final; do not rely on any key material until mainnet. All interfaces, APIs, and data formats are subject to change without notice. The Solana program and all on-chain data will be wiped periodically and everything will be deleted when we transition to Ika Alpha 1. This software is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind; use is entirely at your own risk and dWallet Labs assumes no liability for any damages arising from its use. 

## **Overview** 

Mollusk is the fastest way to test individual instructions in isolation. It runs a single instruction against pre-built account state – no validator, no network, no startup cost. Mollusk is best for: 

- Verifying instruction data parsing 

- Checking signer and account validation 

- Testing discriminator handling Validating PDA creation and field writes 

- Testing error conditions (double votes, closed proposals, missing signers) 

Mollusk **cannot** test CPI calls (e.g., quorum triggering `approve_message` ), because it runs a single program in isolation. 

## **Setup** 

```
[dev-dependencies]
mollusk-svm = "0.2"
solana-account = "2"
solana-instruction = "2"
solana-pubkey = "2"
```

let program_id = Pubkey::new_unique();
let mollusk = Mollusk::new(&program_id, PROGRAM_PATH);
    (mollusk, program_id)
}
```

## **Account Helpers** 

Pre-build account state for test inputs: 

```
fnfunded_account() -> Account {
    Account {
        lamports: 10_000_000_000,
        data: vec![],
        owner: SYSTEM_PROGRAM_ID,
        executable: false,
        rent_epoch: 0,
    }
}
fnprogram_account(owner: &Pubkey, data: Vec<u8>) -> Account {
    Account {
        lamports: ((data.len() asu64 + 128) * 6960).max(1),
        data,

## **LiteSVM Tests** 

**Pre-Alpha Disclaimer:** This is a pre-alpha release for development and testing only. Signing uses a single mock signer, not real distributed MPC. All 11 protocol operations are implemented (DKG, Sign, Presign, FutureSign, ReEncryptShare, etc.) across all 4 curves and 7 signature schemes, but without real MPC security guarantees. The dWallet keys, trust model, and signing protocol are not final; do not rely on any key material until mainnet. All interfaces, APIs, and data formats are subject to change without notice.

This software is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind; use is entirely at your own risk and dWallet Labs assumes no liability for any damages arising from its use. 

## **Overview** 

LiteSVM provides in-process Solana runtime testing. Unlike Mollusk, LiteSVM can: 

- Deploy multiple programs 

- Test CPI calls (e.g., your program calling the dWallet program) Process multiple transactions in sequence Simulate the full transaction lifecycle 

LiteSVM is ideal for testing the integration between your program and the dWallet program, including the CPI authority pattern and `approve_message` calls.

```

## **Testing the CPI Path** 

The key advantage of LiteSVM over Mollusk is testing the quorum -> `approve_message` CPI path: 

```
// Step 1: Initialize dWallet program state (mock the NOA setup)
// Step 2: Create a dWallet
// Step 3: Transfer authority to voting program CPI PDA
// Step 4: Create a proposal
// Step 5: Cast votes until quorum triggers approve_message CPI
// After the final vote, verify MessageApproval was created
let ma_data = svm.get_account(&message_approval_pda).unwrap().data;
assert_eq!(ma_data[0], 14); // MessageApproval discriminator
assert_eq!(ma_data[139], 0); // status = Pending
```

## **When to Use LiteSVM vs Mollusk** 

|**to Use LiteSVM vs**|**Mollusk**||
|---|---|---|
|**Feature**|**Mollusk**|**LiteSVM**|
|Speed|Fastest|Fast|
|CPI testing|No|Yes|
|Multi-program|No|Yes|
|Account persistence|No|Yes|
|Transaction sequencing|No|Yes|
|Error granularity|Instruction level|Transaction level|



Use **Mollusk** for unit-testing individual instructions. Use **LiteSVM** when you need to test cross-program interactions or multi-step flows. 

## **Tips** 

- Pre-populate accounts via `svm.set_account()` to skip setup transactions Use `svm.get_account()` to read account data after transactions Deploy both the dWallet program and your program to test the full CPI flow The CPI authority PDA derivation must use `b"__ika_cpi_authority"` as the seed

## **E2E Tests** 

**Pre-Alpha Disclaimer:** This is a pre-alpha release for development and testing only. Signing uses a single mock signer, not real distributed MPC. All 11 protocol operations are implemented (DKG, Sign, Presign, FutureSign, ReEncryptShare, etc.) across all 4 curves and 7 signature schemes, but without real MPC security guarantees. The dWallet keys, trust model, and signing protocol are not final; do not rely on any key material until mainnet. All interfaces, APIs, and data formats are subject to change without notice. The Solana program and all on-chain data will be wiped periodically and everything will be deleted when we transition to Ika Alpha 1. This software is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind; use is entirely at your own risk and dWallet Labs assumes no liability for any damages arising from its use. 

## **Overview** 

E2E tests run the full dWallet lifecycle against Solana devnet and the pre-alpha dWallet gRPC service. This tests the complete flow including on-chain program execution, CPI, and signing. 

## **Prerequisites** 

|**equisites**||
|---|---|
|**Resource**|**Endpoint**|
|**dWallet gRPC**|`https://pre-alpha-dev-1.ika.ika-network.net:443`|
|**Solana RPC**|`https://api.devnet.solana.com`|



Deploy your program to devnet, then run: 

```
cargo run -p e2e-voting -- <DWALLET_PROGRAM_ID> <VOTING_PROGRAM_ID>
```

## Override endpoints via environment variables: 

```
RPC_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com \
GRPC_URL=pre-alpha-dev-1.ika.ika-network.net:443 \
cargo run -p e2e-voting -- <DWALLET_PROGRAM_ID> <VOTING_PROGRAM_ID>
```

## **E2E Flow** 

The voting E2E demo performs 7 steps: 

## **Step 1: Wait for Program Initialization** 

The mock signer creates: 

**DWalletCoordinator** PDA ( `["dwallet_coordinator"]` ) – 116 bytes 

**NetworkEncryptionKey** PDA ( `["network_encryption_key", noa_pubkey]` ) – 164 bytes 

```
let (coordinator_pda, _) =
    Pubkey::find_program_address(&[b"dwallet_coordinator"],
&dwallet_program_id);
```

```
poll_until(&client, &coordinator_pda, |data| {
    data.len() >= 116 && data[0] == 1// DISC_COORDINATOR
}, Duration::from_secs(30));
```

## **Step 2: Create dWallet** 

The NOA commits a dWallet via `CommitDWallet` (discriminator `31` ): 

The dWallet PDA seeds are `["dwallet", chunks_of(curve_byte ‖ public_key)]` — concatenate the curve byte with the public key into a single buffer, then split into 32-byte chunks (Solana’s `MAX_SEED_LEN` ) and pass each chunk as its own seed. For 32-byte pubkeys (Curve25519/Ristretto/Ed25519) the payload is 33 bytes → chunks `[32, 1]` ; for 33-byte compressed SEC1 pubkeys (Secp256k1/r1) it is 34 bytes → chunks `[32, 2]` . 

```
letmut payload = Vec::with_capacity(1 + public_key.len());
payload.push(curve);
payload.extend_from_slice(&public_key);
```

```
letmut seeds: Vec<&[u8]> = Vec::with_capacity(4);
seeds.push(b"dwallet");
for chunk in payload.chunks(32) {
    seeds.push(chunk);
}
```

```
let (dwallet_pda, dwallet_bump) =
```

```
    Pubkey::find_program_address(&seeds, &dwallet_program_id);
```

30/04/2026, 16:23 

## **Step 3: Transfer Authority** 

Transfer dWallet authority to the voting program’s CPI PDA: 

```
let (cpi_authority, _) = Pubkey::find_program_address(
    &[b"__ika_cpi_authority"],
    &voting_program_id,
);
```

## **Step 4: Create Proposal** 

Create a proposal with quorum = 3: 

```
let message = b"Transfer 100 USDC to treasury";
let message_hash = keccak256(message);
```

## **Step 5: Cast 3 Votes** 

Three voters (Alice, Bob, Charlie) each cast YES. Charlie’s vote reaches quorum and triggers the `approve_message` CPI. 

The last vote transaction includes 10 accounts (5 base + 5 CPI accounts). 

## **Step 6: Verify MessageApproval** 

```
let ma_data = client.get_account(&message_approval_pda)?.data;
assert_eq!(ma_data[0], 14);  // discriminator
assert_eq!(ma_data[139], 0); // status = Pending
```

## **Step 7: Sign and Verify** 

The mock signer signs the message and calls `CommitSignature` (discriminator `43` ): 

```
let signed_data = client.get_account(&message_approval_pda)?.data;
let sig_len = u16::from_le_bytes(signed_data[140..142].try_into().unwrap()) as
usize;
```

```
let signature = &signed_data[142..142 + sig_len];
```

**Pre-Alpha Disclaimer:** This is a pre-alpha release for development and testing only. Signing uses a single mock signer, not real distributed MPC. All 11 protocol operations are implemented (DKG, Sign, Presign, FutureSign, ReEncryptShare, etc.) across all 4 curves and 7 signature schemes, but without real MPC security guarantees. The dWallet keys, trust model, and signing protocol are not final; do not rely on any key material until mainnet. All interfaces, APIs, and data formats are subject to change without notice.

This software is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind; use is entirely at your own risk and dWallet Labs assumes no liability for any damages arising from its use. 

The `ika-dwallet-pinocchio` crate provides a Pinocchio-native CPI SDK for the dWallet program. Pinocchio is the highest-performance Solana program framework — `#![no_std]` , zero-copy, minimal CU overhead. 

## **Dependencies** 

```

|`caller_program`|`&AccountView`|Your program’s account (must be<br>executable)|
|`cpi_authority_bump`|`u8`|Bump seed for the CPI authority PDA|



## **CPI Authority PDA** 

Every program that controls a dWallet derives a single CPI authority PDA: 

```
use ika_dwallet_pinocchio::CPI_AUTHORITY_SEED;
```

```
// Derive at runtime:
let (cpi_authority, bump) = pinocchio::Address::find_program_address(
    &[CPI_AUTHORITY_SEED],
    program_id,
);
```

## **Methods** 

## **approve_message** 

Creates a `MessageApproval` PDA requesting a signature from the Ika network. 

```
ctx.approve_message(
    message_approval,   // &AccountView — PDA to create
    dwallet,            // &AccountView — the dWallet
    payer,              // &AccountView — pays rent
    system_program,     // &AccountView
    message_hash,       // [u8; 32]
    user_pubkey,        // [u8; 32]
    signature_scheme,   // u8: 0=Ed25519, 1=Secp256k1, 2=Secp256r1
    bump,               // u8 — MessageApproval PDA bump
)?;
```

## **transfer_dwallet** 

Transfers dWallet authority to a new pubkey (or another program’s CPI PDA).

dWallet Developer Guide 

30/04/2026, 16:23 

```
ctx.transfer_dwallet(dwallet, &new_authority_bytes)?;
```

## **transfer_future_sign** 

Transfers the completion authority of a `PartialUserSignature` . 

```
ctx.transfer_future_sign(partial_user_sig, &new_authority_bytes)?;
```

## **Example: Voting dWallet** 

Source: `chains/solana/examples/voting/pinocchio/` 

```
#![no_std]
externcrate alloc;
```

```
use pinocchio::{entrypoint, AccountView, Address, ProgramResult};
use ika_dwallet_pinocchio::DWalletContext;
```

```
entrypoint!(process_instruction);
pinocchio::nostd_panic_handler!();
```

```
fnprocess_instruction(
    program_id: &Address,
    accounts: &[AccountView],
```

```
    data: &[u8],
) -> ProgramResult {
match data[0] {
```

   - `0 => create_proposal(program_id, accounts, &data[1..]),` 

   - `1 => cast_vote(program_id, accounts, &data[1..]),` 

- `_ => Err(pinocchio::error::ProgramError::InvalidInstructionData), } }` 

When quorum is reached in `cast_vote` , the program constructs a `DWalletContext` and calls `approve_message` — authorizing the Ika network to sign.

1 => cast_vote(program_id, accounts, &instruction_data[1..]),

    }
}
```

Uses `next_account_info()` for account iteration, `Rent::get()?.minimum_balance()` for rent, and `system_instruction::create_account` + `invoke_signed` for PDA creation. 

When quorum is reached, the program constructs a `DWalletContext` and calls `approve_message` .

## **Anchor Framework (v1.0.0)** 

**Pre-Alpha Disclaimer:** This is an early pre-alpha release for exploring the SDK and starting development only. There is no real MPC signing – all signatures are generated by a single mock signer, not a distributed network. Do not submit any real transactions for signing or rely on any security guarantees. The dWallet keys, trust model, and signing protocol are not final; do not rely on any key material until mainnet. All interfaces, APIs, and data formats are subject to change without notice. The Solana program and all on-chain data will be wiped periodically and everything will be deleted when we transition to Ika Alpha 1. This software is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind; use is entirely at your own risk and dWallet Labs assumes no liability for any damages arising from its use. 

The `ika-dwallet-anchor` crate provides an Anchor-native CPI SDK for the dWallet program. It is the Anchor equivalent of `ika-dwallet-pinocchio` . 

**Anchor v1.0.0** : This SDK uses Anchor’s first stable release (release notes). Key v1 features used: 

- `UncheckedAccount` instead of raw `AccountInfo` in `#[derive(Accounts)]` 

- `InitSpace` derive for automatic space calculation 

- Single `#[error_code]` block per program 

- Solana 3.x compatibility 

## **Dependencies** 

```
[dependencies]
ika-dwallet-anchor = { git = "https://github.com/dwallet-labs/ika-pre-alpha" }
anchor-lang = "1"
```

```
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "lib"]
```

**Note** : Anchor v1 requires Solana CLI 3.x and the Anchor CLI 1.x. Install with: 

```
cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor avm --force
avm install 1.0.0
```

```
avm use 1.0.0

## **transfer_dwallet** 

Transfers dWallet authority to a new pubkey.

## **transfer_future_sign** 

Transfers the completion authority of a `PartialUserSignature` . 

```

## **Example: Voting-Controlled dWallet** 

The `voting-anchor` example demonstrates the full pattern. Proposals reference a dWallet whose authority has been transferred to this program’s CPI authority PDA. When enough yes-votes reach quorum, the program CPI-calls `approve_message` .

**Anchor v1 enforces a single** #[error_code] **block per program.** Multiple blocks now produce a compile-time error. 

## **Key Patterns** 

**PDA-based proposals** — each proposal is a PDA seeded by `[b"proposal", proposal_id]` . 

**One vote per voter** — vote records are PDAs seeded by `[b"vote", proposal_id, voter_pubkey]` , preventing double-voting via Anchor’s `init` constraint. 

**Automatic CPI on quorum** — when `yes_votes >= quorum` , `cast_vote` constructs a `DWalletContext` and calls `approve_message` in the same transaction. 

**UncheckedAccount for cross-program accounts** — dWallet-program-owned accounts use `UncheckedAccount` with `/// CHECK:` comments (v1 best practice, replacing raw `AccountInfo` ).

## **Quasar Framework** 

**Pre-Alpha Disclaimer:** This is an early pre-alpha release for exploring the SDK and starting development only. There is no real MPC signing – all signatures are generated by a single mock signer, not a distributed network. Do not submit any real transactions for signing or rely on any security guarantees. The dWallet keys, trust model, and signing protocol are not final; do not rely on any key material until mainnet. All interfaces, APIs, and data formats are subject to change without notice. The Solana program and all on-chain data will be wiped periodically and everything will be deleted when we transition to Ika Alpha 1. This software is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind; use is entirely at your own risk and dWallet Labs assumes no liability for any damages arising from its use. 

The `ika-dwallet-quasar` crate provides a Quasar-native CPI SDK for the dWallet program. Quasar is a zero-copy Solana program framework with alignment-1 Pod types, declarative account validation, and low-level CPI control via `invoke_signed_unchecked` .

## **Error Codes** 

```
#[error_code]
pubenumVotingError {
    ProposalClosed = 6000,
    InvalidQuorum,
    ArithmeticOverflow,
}
```

## **Key Patterns** 

**Seed components as accounts** – Quasar resolves PDA seeds from account addresses. Pass seed values (like `proposal_id` ) as `UncheckedAccount` fields whose addresses are the seed bytes. 

**Owned account types** – `Signer` , `UncheckedAccount` , `Program<System>` , `Account<T>` are owned (no lifetime parameters or references). 

**Pod arithmetic** – Multi-byte fields are zero-copy Pod types ( `PodU16` , `PodU32` ). Use `.checked_add()` , `.into()` , and direct comparison operators. 

set_inner() **for initialization** – The `#[account(set_inner)]` macro generates a companion `Inner` struct with original Rust types for initialization.

**Stack-allocated CPI** – The Quasar SDK uses `invoke_signed_unchecked` with stack-allocated buffers (no heap allocation), making it the most CU-efficient CPI variant. 

## **When to Use Quasar** 

|**Consideration**|**Pinocchio**|**Native**|**Anchor**|**Quasar**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**CU efciency**|Best|Good|Good|Best|
|**Binary size**|Smallest|Medium|Largest|Small|
|no_std**support**|Yes|No|No|Yes|
|**Account validation**|Manual|Manual|Declarative|Declarative|
|**Zero-copy**|Manual|No|No|Built-in|
|**Learning curve**|Steepest|Medium|Easiest|Medium|



Choose Quasar when you want declarative account validation (like Anchor) combined with zero-copy performance (like Pinocchio), built-in Pod types for safe zero-copy field access, and `no_std` compatibility. 

## **Differences from Other SDKs** 

||**Pinocchio**|**Anchor**|**Quasar**||
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Account**<br>**types**|`&AccountView`|`AccountInfo`|Owned<br>`Signer`/<br>`UncheckedAccount`||
|**CPI**|`invoke_signed`|`invoke_signed`<br>(via<br>`solana_program`)|`invoke_signed_unchecked`||
|**CPI data**|Heap<br>`Vec`|Heap<br>`Vec`|Stack<br>`[u8; N]`||
|**Instruction**<br>**dispatch**|Manual<br>`match`|`#[program]`<br>(hash-based)|`#[program]`+<br>`#`<br>`[instruction(discriminato`<br>`= N)]`||

|**Account**<br>**init**|Manual<br>`CreateAccount`|`#`<br>`[account(init)]`|`#[account(init)]`||
|**Error**<br>**handling**|`ProgramResult`|`Result<()>`|`Result<(), ProgramError>`||

## **TypeScript Client** 

**Pre-Alpha Disclaimer:** This is a pre-alpha release for development and testing only. Signing uses a single mock signer, not real distributed MPC. All 11 protocol operations are implemented (DKG, Sign, Presign, FutureSign, ReEncryptShare, etc.) across all 4 curves and 7 signature schemes, but without real MPC security guarantees. The dWallet keys, trust model, and signing protocol are not final; do not rely on any key material until mainnet. All interfaces, APIs, and data formats are subject to change without notice. The Solana program and all on-chain data will be wiped periodically and everything will be deleted when we transition to Ika Alpha 1. This software is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind; use is entirely at your own risk and dWallet Labs assumes no liability for any damages arising from its use. 

The `@ika.xyz/pre-alpha-solana-client` package provides a TypeScript client for interacting with the dWallet program on Solana. Built on `@solana/kit` (web3.js v2). 

## **Installation**

## **gRPC Client** 

## For submitting dWallet operations (DKG, Sign, Presign) via gRPC: 

```
// The gRPC client uses BCS-serialized request/response types.
// See the gRPC API section for details on SubmitTransaction.
```

```
// Connect to the pre-alpha dWallet gRPC service
const GRPC_URL = "pre-alpha-dev-1.ika.ika-network.net:443";
```

```
// gRPC types are defined in proto/ika_dwallet.proto
```

```
// Use a gRPC client library (e.g., @grpc/grpc-js or connectrpc) to call:
//   DWalletService.SubmitTransaction(UserSignedRequest) -> TransactionResponse
```

## **Examples** 

**Pre-Alpha Disclaimer:** This is a pre-alpha release for development and testing only. Signing uses a single mock signer, not real distributed MPC. All 11 protocol operations are implemented (DKG, Sign, Presign, FutureSign, ReEncryptShare, etc.) across all 4 curves and 7 signature schemes, but without real MPC security guarantees. The dWallet keys, trust model, and signing protocol are not final; do not rely on any key material until mainnet. All interfaces, APIs, and data formats are subject to change without notice. The Solana program and all on-chain data will be wiped periodically and everything will be deleted when we transition to Ika Alpha 1. This software is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind; use is entirely at your own risk and dWallet Labs assumes no liability for any damages arising from its use. 

## **Overview** 

The Ika SDK ships with two complete example programs demonstrating different patterns for program-controlled dWallet signing: 

|**Example**|**Pattern**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|Voting|Governance|Open voting with quorum — anyone can vote,<br>quorum triggers signing|
|Multisig|Access<br>Control|M-of-N multisig — fxed members, threshold<br>approval triggers signing|



## **Structure** 

Each example follows the same directory layout:

```

## **Common Flow** 

Both examples follow the same high-level flow: 

1. **Create dWallet** via gRPC DKG request — the mock commits on-chain and transfers authority to the caller 

2. **Transfer authority** to the example program’s CPI authority PDA ( `["__ika_cpi_authority"]` ) 

3. **Create proposal/transaction** — on-chain state describing what to sign 

4. **Collect approvals** — votes or multisig member approvals 

5. **CPI** approve_message  — when threshold is reached, the program calls the dWallet program to create a `MessageApproval` PDA 

6. **gRPC presign + sign** — allocate a presign, then sign via gRPC with `ApprovalProof` referencing the on-chain approval 

7. **Signature returned** — 64-byte Ed25519 signature for the approved message

Deploy your example program to devnet, then run E2E tests against the pre-alpha environment: 

```
# TypeScript (recommended)
just e2e-voting <DWALLET_ID> <VOTING_ID>
just e2e-multisig <DWALLET_ID> <MULTISIG_ID>
```

```
# Rust (alternative)
just e2e-voting-rust <DWALLET_ID> <VOTING_ID>
just e2e-multisig-rust <DWALLET_ID> <MULTISIG_ID>
```

## **Unit Tests (Mollusk)** 

Mollusk tests run in-process with no network dependency: 

```
just test-examples-mollusk
```

## **Shared Helpers** 

TypeScript e2e tests use shared helpers from `examples/_shared/` : 

- helpers.ts  — Colored logging ( `log` , `ok` , `val` ), `sendTx` , `pda` , `pollUntil` , `createAndFundKeypair` 

- 

- ika setup.ts  — BCS types matching `ika-dwallet-types` , gRPC client, 

- `setupDWallet()` , `requestPresign()` , `requestSign()` 

These helpers handle the full dWallet lifecycle (DKG, on-chain polling, authority transfer) so example e2e tests focus on their specific program logic.

## **Voting Example** 

**Pre-Alpha Disclaimer:** This is a pre-alpha release for development and testing only. Signing uses a single mock signer, not real distributed MPC. All 11 protocol operations are implemented (DKG, Sign, Presign, FutureSign, ReEncryptShare, etc.) across all 4 curves and 7 signature schemes, but without real MPC security guarantees.

This software is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind; use is entirely at your own risk and dWallet Labs assumes no liability for any damages arising from its use. 

## **Overview** 

A governance program where anyone can create proposals referencing a dWallet. Voters cast yes/no votes, and when the quorum of yes votes is reached, the program automatically CPI-calls `approve_message` on the dWallet program to authorize signing. 

**Use case:** DAO governance, treasury management, group signing authorization. 

## **Program Design** 

## **Accounts** 

|**Accounts**||||
|---|---|---|---|
|**Account**|**Seeds**|**Size**|**Description**|
|Proposal|`["proposal",`<br>`proposal_id]`|195<br>bytes|Stores vote counts, quorum,<br>message hash, dWallet<br>reference|
|VoteRecord|`["vote",`<br>`proposal_id,`<br>`voter]`|69<br>bytes|Prevents double voting — one<br>per voter per proposal|

## **Instructions** 

|**Disc**|**Instruction**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|`0`|CreateProposal|Create a proposal with message hash, quorum, and<br>dWallet reference|
|`1`|CastVote|Record a vote; when quorum reached, CPI-calls<br>`approve_message`|



## **Proposal Layout (195 bytes)** 

```
disc(1) + version(1) + proposal_id(32) + dwallet(32) + message_hash(32) +
user_pubkey(32) + signature_scheme(1) + creator(32) + yes_votes(4) +
no_votes(4) + quorum(4) + status(1) + message_approval_bump(1) +
bump(1) + _reserved(16)
```

## **Key Offsets** 

|**Field**|**Ofset**|**Size**|**Type**|
|---|---|---|---|
|yes_votes|163|4|u32 LE|
|no_votes|167|4|u32 LE|
|quorum|171|4|u32 LE|
|status|175|1|0=Open, 1=Approved|



## **CPI Flow** 

When `yes_votes >= quorum` , the program: 

1. Reads message hash, user pubkey, and signature scheme from the Proposal account 

2. Constructs a `DWalletContext` with the CPI authority PDA 

3. Calls `ctx.approve_message(...)` which creates a `MessageApproval` PDA on the dWallet program 

4. Sets proposal status to Approved 

The caller then sends a gRPC `Sign` request with `ApprovalProof::Solana { transaction_signature, slot }` to obtain the actual signature.

dWallet Developer Guide 

30/04/2026, 16:23 

## **E2E Flow** 

`1. gRPC DKG          → dWallet created on-chain, authority = caller` 

`2. Transfer authority → CPI PDA owns the dWallet` 

`3. Create proposal    → quorum=3, message="Transfer 100 USDC"` 

`4. Cast 3 YES votes   → last vote triggers approve_message CPI` 

`5. Verify approval    → MessageApproval PDA exists, status=Pending` 

`6. gRPC presign       → allocate presign` 

`7. gRPC sign          → 64-byte signature returned` 

## **Testing**

# Mollusk (instruction-level, no infrastructure needed)

## **Key Patterns** 

## **Building Test Account Data** 

Tests pre-populate account data with exact byte layouts: 

```
fnbuild_proposal_data(
    proposal_id: &[u8; 32], dwallet: &Pubkey,
    message_hash: &[u8; 32], authority: &Pubkey,
    yes_votes: u32, no_votes: u32, quorum: u32,
    status: u8, bump: u8,
) -> Vec<u8> {
letmut data = vec![0u8; PROPOSAL_LEN]; // 195 bytes
    data[0] = PROPOSAL_DISCRIMINATOR;       // 1
    data[1] = 1;                            // version
    data[PROP_PROPOSAL_ID..PROP_PROPOSAL_ID + 32].copy_from_slice(proposal_id);
// ... set all fields at correct offsets
    data
}
```

## **Verifying Results** 

After processing an instruction, read the resulting account data: 

```
let result = mollusk.process_instruction(&ix, &accounts);
assert!(result.program_result.is_ok());
```

```
let prop_data = &result.resulting_accounts[0].1.data;
assert_eq!(read_u32(prop_data, PROP_YES_VOTES), 1);
assert_eq!(prop_data[PROP_STATUS], STATUS_OPEN);

```
═══ E2E Test Passed! ═══
```

## **How the Shared Helpers Work** 

The TypeScript e2e imports from `_shared/` : 

```
import { setupDWallet, requestPresign, requestSign } from"../../_shared/ika-
setup.ts";
```

```
import { log, ok, val, sendTx, pda, pollUntil } from
"../../_shared/helpers.ts";
```

`setupDWallet()` handles the entire dWallet lifecycle: 

1. Waits for program initialization (polls for DWalletCoordinator PDA) 

2. Sends gRPC DKG request (creates dWallet on-chain + transfers authority) 

3. Polls for dWallet PDA to appear 

4. Transfers authority to the example program’s CPI PDA 

This means the e2e test code only needs to focus on the voting-specific logic.

## **Multisig Example** 

**Pre-Alpha Disclaimer:** This is a pre-alpha release for development and testing only. Signing uses a single mock signer, not real distributed MPC. All 11 protocol operations are implemented (DKG, Sign, Presign, FutureSign, ReEncryptShare, etc.) across all 4 curves and 7 signature schemes, but without real MPC security guarantees. The dWallet keys, trust model, and signing protocol are not final; do not rely on any key material until mainnet. All interfaces, APIs, and data formats are subject to change without notice. The Solana program and all on-chain data will be wiped periodically and everything will be deleted when we transition to Ika Alpha 1. This software is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind; use is entirely at your own risk and dWallet Labs assumes no liability for any damages arising from its use. 

## **Overview** 

An M-of-N multisig program controlling a dWallet. Fixed members are set at creation. Any member can propose transactions with message data stored on-chain for other members to inspect. Members approve or reject. When threshold approvals are reached, the program CPI-calls `approve_message` and optionally `transfer_future_sign` . When enough rejections accumulate (making approval impossible), the transaction is marked rejected. 

**Use case:** Multi-party custody, organizational signing policies, timelocked operations.

## **Rejection Logic** 

A transaction is rejected when enough members reject that approval becomes impossible: 

```
rejection_threshold = member_count - threshold + 1
```

For a 2-of-3 multisig: `3 - 2 + 1 = 2` rejections needed to reject. 

## **CPI Flow** 

When `approval_count >= threshold` , the program: 

1. Calls `ctx.approve_message(...)` — creates `MessageApproval` PDA 

2. If `partial_user_sig` is set (non-zero), calls `ctx.transfer_future_sign(...)` — transfers the partial signature completion authority to the proposer 

3. Sets transaction status to Approved 

## **E2E Flow** 

`1.  gRPC DKG           → dWallet created, authority = caller` 

`2.  Transfer authority  → CPI PDA owns the dWallet` 

`3.  Create multisig     → 2-of-3 with 3 member pubkeys` 

`4.  Propose transaction → message data stored on-chain` 

`5.  Member1 approves    → approval_count = 1` 

`6.  Member2 approves    → approval_count = 2 = threshold → CPI!` 

`7.  Verify approval     → MessageApproval exists` 

`8.  gRPC presign        → allocate presign` 

`9.  gRPC sign           → 64-byte signature` 

`10. Rejection test      → propose 2nd tx, 2 rejections → status=Rejected` 

## **React Frontend** 

A React frontend is included at `chains/solana/examples/multisig/react/` with: 

- Create dWallet + Multisig (via gRPC-web client) 

- Propose transactions 

- Approve/reject as a member

## **2. Instructions** 

|**Disc**|**Name**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|0|CreateMultisig|Set members (up to 10), threshold, dWallet reference|
|1|CreateTransaction|Propose with message data stored on-chain|
|2|Approve|Vote yes; triggers CPI at threshold|
|3|Reject|Vote no; marks rejected when impossible to approve|



## **3. Rejection Threshold** 

A transaction is rejected when enough members reject that approval becomes impossible: 

```
rejection_threshold = member_count - threshold + 1
```

Example: 2-of-3 multisig → `3 - 2 + 1 = 2` rejections needed. 

## **4. CPI Flow on Approval** 

When `approval_count >= threshold` : 

```
// 1. Approve the message (creates MessageApproval PDA)
ctx.approve_message(
```

```
    message_approval, dwallet, payer, system_program,
    message_hash, user_pubkey, signature_scheme,
    message_approval_bump,
```

```
)?;
```

```
// 2. Optionally transfer future sign authority
if partial_user_sig != [0u8; 32] {
    ctx.transfer_future_sign(partial_user_sig_account, proposer_key)?;
}
```

```
// 3. Mark transaction as approved
tx_data[TX_STATUS] = STATUS_APPROVED;

## **Account Reference** 

**Pre-Alpha Disclaimer:** This is a pre-alpha release for development and testing only. Signing uses a single mock signer, not real distributed MPC. All 11 protocol operations are implemented (DKG, Sign, Presign, FutureSign, ReEncryptShare, etc.) across all 4 curves and 7 signature schemes, but without real MPC security guarantees. The dWallet keys, trust model, and signing protocol are not final; do not rely on any key material until mainnet. All interfaces, APIs, and data formats are subject to change without notice. The Solana program and all on-chain data will be wiped periodically and everything will be deleted when we transition to Ika Alpha 1. This software is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind; use is entirely at your own risk and dWallet Labs assumes no liability for any damages arising from its use. 

All account types in the Ika dWallet system. Each account starts with a 2-byte prefix: `discriminator(1) | version(1)` , followed by the account data.

The dWallet program emits events via Anchor-compatible self-CPI. Events are emitted as inner instructions and can be parsed from transaction metadata. 

## **Anchor-Compatible Event Format** 

Events use the same wire format as Anchor events: 

```
EVENT_IX_TAG_LE(8) | event_discriminator(1) | event_data(N)
```

The `EVENT_IX_TAG_LE` is 8 bytes ( `0xe4a545ea51cb9a1d` in little-endian). The event discriminator follows, then the event-specific data. 

## **Key Events** 

## **MessageApprovalCreated** 

Emitted when `approve_message` creates a new `MessageApproval` PDA.

|||dWallet Developer Guide|
|---|---|---|
|**Field**|**Size**|**Description**|
|message_hash|32|Hash of the message to sign|
|caller_program|32|Program that approved|



The Ika network listens for this event to initiate the signing protocol. 

## **SignatureCommitted** 

Emitted when the NOA calls `commit_signature` to write a signature. 

|**Field**|**Size**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|message_approval|32|MessageApproval account pubkey|
|signature_len|2|Length of the signature|



Off-chain clients can listen for this to know when a signature is ready. 

## **DWalletCreated** 

Emitted when `commit_dwallet` creates a new dWallet. 

|`t_dwallet`cre|ates a ne|w dWallet.|
|---|---|---|
|**Field**|**Size**|**Description**|
|dwallet|32|New dWallet pubkey|
|authority|32|Initial authority|
|curve|1|Curve identifer|



## **AuthorityTransferred** 

Emitted when `transfer_ownership` changes a dWallet’s authority. 

|**Field**|**Size**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|dwallet|32|dWallet pubkey|
|old_authority|32|Previous authority|
|new_authority|32|New authority|



## **Parsing Events** 

Events appear as inner instructions in the transaction metadata. To parse them:

1. Find inner instructions targeting the dWallet program 

2. Match the first 8 bytes against `EVENT_IX_TAG_LE` 

3. Read the 1-byte event discriminator 

4. Deserialize the remaining bytes according to the event schema 

## **Example: Detecting Signatures** 

```
use solana_transaction_status::UiTransactionEncoding;
```

```
let tx = client.get_transaction_with_config(
    &tx_signature,
    RpcTransactionConfig {
```

```
Some(UiTransactionEncoding::Base64),
```

```
        commitment: Some(CommitmentConfig::confirmed()),
        max_supported_transaction_version: Some(0),
    },
)?;
```

- `// Parse inner instructions for SignatureCommitted events if let Some(meta) = tx.transaction.meta {` 

- `for inner_ix in meta.inner_instructions.unwrap_or_default() {` 

```
for ix in inner_ix.instructions {
```

- `// Check EVENT_IX_TAG_LE prefix and parse event data` 

```
    }
}
```

## **Example: Polling for MessageApproval Status** 

Rather than parsing events, you can poll the `MessageApproval` account directly: 

```
loop {
let data = client.get_account(&message_approval_pda)?.data;
if data[139] == 1 { // status == Signed
```

```
let sig_len = u16::from_le_bytes(data[140..142].try_into().unwrap()) as
usize;
```

```
let signature = data[142..142 + sig_len].to_vec();
break;
    }
    std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500));
}
```

## **Event vs Polling** 

|**Approach**|**Pros**|**Cons**|
|---|---|---|
|**Event**<br>**parsing**|Immediate notifcation, no<br>polling|Requires transaction metadata,<br>more complex|
|**Account**<br>**polling**|Simple, works everywhere|Latency, wasted RPC calls|



For production use, event-based detection is recommended. For testing and simple scripts, polling is sufficient.
