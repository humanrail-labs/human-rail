# HumanRail Protocol

> Identity Rails for AI Agents on Solana

HumanRail is an open protocol for **verified human identity**, **delegated agent authority**, and **full on-chain auditability**. As AI agents become more autonomous, the question shifts from "what can they do?" to "who authorized them and can we verify it?" HumanRail provides the missing trust layer — a **Know Your Agent (KYA)** protocol where every agent traces back to a verified human, every action is bounded by explicit capabilities, and every transaction leaves an immutable receipt.

## Grant Track: HumanRail Guarded dWallets with Ika

> **Decentralized guardrails for autonomous agents holding assets across chains.**

HumanRail provides the **policy layer** — identity, delegation, spending limits, freeze, and receipts — already deployed as 7 programs on Solana devnet.

**Ika** provides the **cross-chain signing layer** — 2PC-MPC dWallets that can produce signatures for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other chains.

Together, they enable a verified human principal to deploy an AI agent that can sign cross-chain transactions — but only within programmable limits that live entirely on Solana.

### Grant Demo Scope

The grant demo focuses on the HumanRail programs that form the policy core:
- **Human Registry** — Verified identity before any agent action
- **Agent Registry** — KYA lifecycle management
- **Delegation / Capabilities** — Programmable scopes and spending limits
- **Receipts** — Immutable audit trail for every policy check and Ika approval

A new **HumanRail dWallet Guard** program will be built to act as the CPI controller between HumanRail policies and Ika signing.

> **Pre-alpha disclaimer:** Ika is currently pre-alpha with a single mock signer. All demo interactions use devnet only. This is not production MPC custody.

See [`docs/GRANT_IKA_SUBMISSION_PLAN.md`](docs/GRANT_IKA_SUBMISSION_PLAN.md) for the full submission plan and [`docs/IKA_TECHNICAL_NOTES.md`](docs/IKA_TECHNICAL_NOTES.md) for implementation details.

## Protocol Architecture

Four layers. Seven programs. One unified trust stack.

| Layer | Programs | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Identity Layer** | Human Registry · Agent Registry | Verified human profiles and AI agent lifecycle management |
| **Authorization Layer** | Delegation · Capabilities · Freeze | Bounded authority with spending limits, scopes, and emergency controls |
| **Rails Layer** | HumanPay · DataBlink · Document Registry | PDA-controlled payments, data actions, and on-chain document signing |
| **Audit Layer** | Receipts · Compliance Trail | Immutable action logs for every protocol interaction |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm or pnpm

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

The example file already contains the correct devnet program IDs.

### Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Core Concepts

### Human Registry
- On-chain human profiles with attestation-based trust scoring
- Third-party issuer attestations (KYC, Biometric, Social, Government ID)
- `canRegisterAgents` flag controls who can spawn agents

### Agent Registry (KYA)
- Agents are PDAs owned by a verified human principal
- Lifecycle states: `Active`, `Suspended`, `Revoked`
- Features: key rotation, TEE measurement verification, metadata updates
- Operator stats track transaction history and risk scoring

### Delegation
- **Capabilities** are scoped authority tokens issued to agents
- Limits: per-transaction, daily, total spending caps
- Constraints: program scopes, asset allowlists, max slippage, max fee, expiry
- **Emergency Freeze** allows principals to instantly halt an agent's capabilities
- Risk tiers enforce behavioral guardrails

### HumanPay
- PDA-controlled escrow payments
- Invoice creation with capability-checked authorization
- Dispute resolution support

### Document Registry
- On-chain document hash verification
- Multi-signer attestation support

### Receipts & DataBlink
- Every protocol interaction emits an immutable receipt
- Compliance-ready audit trails from day one

## Roadmap

### V1 — Identity + Agent Authorization
- [x] Canonical human profile and agent profile
- [x] Capabilities v1 (scopes, limits, allowlists, expiry)
- [x] Receipts v1 (standard action log)
- [ ] TypeScript SDK + documentation
- [ ] Issuer framework + revocation
- [ ] Trust tiers UI (Tier 0 / 1 / 2 badges)

### V2 — Ecosystem Modules
- Payment rails with full escrow
- Task marketplace
- Runtime attestations (TEE / signed builds)

---

## Security & Compliance

- All sensitive credentials (e.g., Veriff KYC secrets) live in the **backend KYC issuer service only**
- Frontend uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_` vars for program IDs and RPC endpoints
- Never commit `.env.local` to version control
