# HumanRail

HumanRail is a unified human identity and confidential payment fabric on Solana.

It combines onchain identity, proof-of-personhood, and confidential stablecoin payments, and exposes them through Actions/Blinks as a token-incentivized RLHF and human-task rail.

## Status

This repository is an early skeleton. Most programs, services, and the web demo are not yet production-ready and may not compile.
We will implement each component incrementally and track work through GitHub issues.
